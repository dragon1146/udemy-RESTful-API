this is a continuation of the notes that was started in notebook


- when the image is ran, it exited right away - this is because the container must be ran up
with a process running in the background of the ubuntu image

- i created a new image from a python3 base image with the following
int in its Dockerfile
    FROM python:3
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY ./requirements.txt .
    RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
    COPY . /app
    CMD [ "python3", "/app/app.py" ]

- to allow the API to be reach insid the container, the app.run
parameters needed to be changed to the following
    - app.run(port=5000, debug=True, host = '0.0.0.0')

- to run the container i executed the following command
    - docker run -it --name glitch00 -p 8000:5000 glitch-img:latest 
        - this will give the container a custom name of "glitch00"
        - it will map port 8000 on the host physical interface to
        port 5000 on the container
            - any other host that sends a request to the host's
            physical interface on port 8000 (192.168.0.78:8000) will
            be redirecting to the container on port 5000
